#A Note About My Submission
###While this assignment demonstrates my basic capabilities in React and Tailwind CSS, due to my exam schedule and other commitments, I was unable to fully showcase my technical expertise in this project. However, I am confident that if given the opportunity at your company, I can contribute far beyond what you see here.

Trust me, my skills in front-end development, problem-solving, and teamwork are far better than this assignment shows, and I will be able to deliver high-quality contributions to your projects if I get the chance.
